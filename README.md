# Eve the Event Bot

## Description
Eve is a discord bot that allows user to create events in their guild. Let's say you want to play a game of Valorant with your friends. 
Texting them all individually or sending a basic message into your discord server is a hassle that can result in either no one replying on time
or too many people replying and someone being left out.

I created Eve to simplify this process. With Eve, you can simply create a Valorant event and set a time. Eve will send a event into your guild's 
event server that user's can react to to join the lobby
